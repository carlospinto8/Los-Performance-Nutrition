            WHAT ARE BRANCHED-CHAIN AMINO ACIDS?
        </p>
        <P>
            Branched-chain amino acids consist of three of the essential amino acids our bodies cannot make on its own and must be obtained from a food source. 
            These three amino acids are essential for building muscle:
        </P>
        <p>
            Leucine: Considered the most important of the three, leucine helps maintain energy levels by stabilizing glucose in the bloodstream. 
            Leucine is important for building muscle because it assists in the production of muscle tissue. 
            It can also help with recovery because leucine boosts our ability to heal muscles. This reduces soreness. Leucine can lead to an increase in muscle tissue.
        </p>
        <p>
            Isoleucine: Our bodies cannot produce isoleucine, and we must get it from some outside source. 
            Nutritional sources are the main way we obtain isoleucine, but protein supplements can also provide this essential amino acid.
        </p>
        <p>
            Valine: Similar to leucine and isoleucine, valine helps build muscle by bringing more glucose to the muscles as they are stressed and worked. 
            On its own, valine does not build muscle, but when taken with leucine and isoleucine, it helps facilitate greater muscle development. 
            Valine also assists with brain function, and it can help you sleep.
