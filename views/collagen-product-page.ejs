        <p class="faq-question">WHAT IS COLLAGEN?</p>
        <p>
            Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body and serves as a building block for connective tissue. 
            It makes up roughly one-third of your body's protein composition and is a major component for skin elasticity, bone density, tendons, muscles, and cartilage. 
            As you age, your body gradually produces lower amounts of collagen, 
            which can cause poor joint mobility, brittle bones, skin wrinkles, and weaker hair and nails.

        <p class="faq-question">WHAT IS IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COLLAGEN PROTEIN AND WHEY PROTEIN?</p>
        <p>
            Whey protein is sourced from cow’s milk and Collagen from bovine hide. They contain different amino acid profiles, 
            which gives each protein different functions in the body. Whey protein is a complete protein, and Collagen is not. 
            Collagen is high in the amino acids glycine, proline, and hydroxyproline.
